## TODOS: 
- [x] Authentication: login/register system using JWT.
- [x] **PDF Upload:** file upload functionality using multer to accept PDF files
- [X] **Convert PDF to Image Thumbnail**: Convert uploaded PDFs into a single image as first page. 
- [x] **Upload to S3 Bucket**: Store the image in S3 and get a viewable public URL.
  - [x] save file data (metadata) in the database simultaneously.
  - [ ] delete the image + pdf for local storage. 
- [x] **Generate Embedding on Upload**: Use OpenAI embeddings for each uploaded document.
- [x] **Storing Embeddings in PostgreSQL**: Save embeddings using `pgvector` for fast similarity search.
- [x] **SSE with Live LLM Output**: Stream LLM responses in real-time using Server-Sent Events,
  - [x] create Short live token, for SSE request (as they don't support bearear token)
  - [x] save chats in the database simultaneously.
- [ ] Create embedding for user prompt
- [ ] Fetch nearest chunks from stored embeddings
- [ ] Combine prompt + chunks
- [ ] Send to LLM for grounded response
- [ ] User credit score: fuctionality to limit the chat per user.
- [ ] **Delete PDF**: allowing users to delete the PDF.
  - [ ] delete the embedding+chunks of the upload.
  - [ ] delete the image thumbnail from s3 bucket.
  - [ ] delete complete metadata of upload.
### Important: 
- [ ] **Deployment:**
  - [ ] Setup Docker for production: 
  - [ ] CI pipeline: for
